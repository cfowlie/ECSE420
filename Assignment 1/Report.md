## Question 1.6
  Graph 1.4: Runtime decreases until a certain point. Afterwards, it continually increases. This makes sense, as after a certain point, the overhead generated from creating and switching threads causes diminishing returns, and eventually a decrease in performance (past the optimal thread count). This can be explained by the fact that there can only be so many actual physical threads, and past a certain point the threads being created and used are virtual, which creates more and more overhead.
  
  Graph 1.5: The sequential multiplication run time is of O(n^3), therefore it increases greatly as n (here: matrix size) increases. However for n rather small (<=500) the overhead generated by creating and switching threads during parallel multiplication is large enough to cause sequential multiplication to run faster. However as n increases, the parallelization of the process allows the parallel multiplication�s runtime to increase at a much slower rate than O(n^3), causing it to eventually be slower than sequential multiplication�s runtime.

## Question 2.2
 Deadlock can be avoided in multiple ways with this example:
 
    - 1: Forcing threads to release resources after certain time to allow other request to complete
    - 2: Requiring an order of resources that ensures no deadlock (must have A to request B)
    - 3: Deadlock detection and avoidance (See Bankers algorithm)

## Question 4

### 4.1
The limit would be reached if we theoretically have infinite processors working on the parallel section.
This would result in the parrallel section (60%) happening instantly, leaving only 40% of the processing time as the maximum possible speed up.
This results in a speed up maximum of 2.5x.
